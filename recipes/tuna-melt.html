    <h1>Tuna Melt</h1>
    <img src=../images/melt.jpg>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The tuna melt: one of my go-to sandwiches as a broke college student. Finely diced onions and celery are vigorously mashed together with canned tuna, mayo and lime.<br>
        Then placed between two slices of buttered and toasted white bread, topped wtih cheddar cheese and melted to perfection. Despite it's simplicity this is nothing short of a work of art.<br>
        This simple recipe will completly change how you see the canned tuna thats been in your cabniet for months and demonstrate that you dont need the best ingredients to make something delicious.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>   
        <li>1 (5-ounce; 142 g) canned oil- or water-packed tuna, drained well</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 g) Hellmann's mayonnaise (see note)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 4 (1/2-inch-thick) slices of white sandwich bread</li>
        <li>Clarified butter, and/or melted butter, for brushing the bread</li>
        <li>4 slices Cheddar or American cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 a small onions</li>
        <li>1 small of stick of celery</li>
        <li>1 small lime</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open and strain your tuna with a mesh strainer. Make sure to get out as much water as possible and then set aside ontop of a bowl to continue draining.</li>
        <li>Dice the onion and celery and set aside.</li>
        <li>Then transfer tuna to a large bowl and add the 1/2 cup of mayo with salt and pepper to taste and mash the tuna until there are not large chunks left.</li>
        <li>Mix the in the juice of one lime and add diced celery and onions.</li>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Using a pastry brush, lightly but evenly brush both sides of each slice of bread with oil, clarified butter, or melted butter. 
            In a large cast iron or nonstick skillet, or using a griddle, toast bread slices on first side over medium heat until nicely browned and crisp, about 3 minutes; using a cooking weight or spatula, gently press down on bread slices while toasting to ensure even heating and browning</li>
        <li>Flip bread and lay one slice of cheese on top of each bread slice. Mound tuna salad on top of 2 of the bread slices, spreading it in an even layer. Close sandwiches, placing top bread slices cheese side down, 
            and continue to cook until bottom of sandwich is well toasted; press down gently on sandwich with cooking 
            weights or a spatula to ensure even heating and browning.</li>
        <li>Flip tuna melt and cook until second side is well toasted. If your cheese at this point isn't melted enough, transfer sandwiches to a baking sheet and heat in oven until cheese is well melted, about 3 minutes. Serve.</li>
